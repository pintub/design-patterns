##### Interpreter Pattern
- **Naming** `To define the grammar of a particular language and interpret sentences written in that language`
- **When To Use**
    - To define grammar , UML pretty much resembles Composite pattern
- **Brute Force Programming**
    - ???
- **Intuitive Example**
    - Programming Language Compilers
- **UML**
    - [UML](UML.puml)
- [**Code Example**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/interpreter_pattern.htm)
- **Pros** 
    - ???
- **Cons**
    - ???    
- **Comparision with Other Patterns**
    - Composite Pattern (because of UML diagram)
        - Pattern purpose is different ,one is Structural , other is Behavioral pattern. That gives an idea that behavioral pattern solves a particular specific responsibility(instead of generic) issue . For example, Interpreter helps interpret a sentence in a language, Observer helps in Nofity-Subscriber problem .  Interpreter can be thought as a usecase of composite pattern iff all class has `same behavior`
