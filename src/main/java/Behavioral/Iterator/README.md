##### Iterator Pattern
- **Naming** `Encapsulating Iteration/Traversal Algorithm away from Actual Collection`
- **When To Use**
    - When Iteration logic is complex and there can be multiple ways of iteration (For example, Tree has BFS, DFS and may be more complex ones)
    - Iterator can give one element after another ,rather giving whole collection (Remember, java's `Iterator.next()`). Client also can do lazy processing of elements and can stop at a point if the goal is achieved .
    - Client won't have to know about internal implementation of IterableCollection and write complex iteration logic . Whoever creates the complex IterableCollection should write the Iterator as well .
    - Iterator interface can serve different collections (Remember, Stack, ArraysList, LinkedList irrespective of their implementation , So each of this class has `Iterator` implementation returned by `list.iterator()` for example)
- **Brute Force Programming**
    - Each Client of IterableCollection has to program the traversing logic as well .
- **Intuitive Example**
    - com.util.iterator
- **UML**
    - [UML](UML.puml)
- **Code Example**
    - Java `Iterator`
- **Pros**
    - IterableCollection will focus on only Collection and operations (like push, pop etc) and traversal decoupled
    - Ease of use for Client
- **Cons**
    - ???
- **Comparision with Other Patterns**
    - Just a thought, Should ConcreteIterator class be inner class of ConcreteIterableCollection class as both are tightly coupled .
