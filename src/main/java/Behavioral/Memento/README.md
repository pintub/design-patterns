##### Memento Pattern
- **Naming** `Save object State snapshot(`Movie Memento`) and undo at will`
- **When To Use**
    - When you want to keep track of state transition of an object and perform save/restore(undo) at will
    - Encapsulate the state Snapshot into `memento` class , It is strongly dependent on `Original` class , not outside access to getState() of memento object , Only Original class save and restore the memento
    - Encapsulate the state Snapshot set into `MementoCareTaker` class, It maintains the container of memento objects
- **Brute Force Programming**

- **Intuitive Example**
    - Undo/Redo Editor State (Notice the difference between [Command pattern Undo example](../Command/README.md))
- **UML**
    - [UML](UML.puml)
- [**Code Example**](./example)
- **Pros**
    - Undo operation
- **Cons**
    - ???
- **Comparision with Other Patterns**
    - vs Command (Because of Undo a feature )
        -  Command Pattern can undo series of commands, Memento can undo states
- **Additional Note**
    - Memento class can be public(non private,cause CareTaker needs reference of Memento) static inner class of Originator class
