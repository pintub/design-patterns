##### Command Pattern
- **Naming** `Encapsulating Command or Request and Decouple a CommandInvoker and CommandReceiver`
- **When To Use**
    - When you want to parameterize the CommandReceiver behavior by encapsulating Command
    - When Client need to maintain a list of commands ,i.e. a MacroCommand delegating task to mini commands . Yet again Note , MacroCommand is only useful if it is re-usable, else listing should be handling at Client Side , else If there are 'n' number of commands, `2^n` number of MacroCommand possible , which will be unnecessary if not re-used.
    - When Client needs to have execute /unExecute(undo) on CommandReceiver actions. Undo is one good idea is Database DML operations . Suppose you have doing a DB operation in this sequence (Insert to TableA->Insert to TableB->Insert to TableC) , then if Inset to TableB fails(middle stage) , it should undo TableB insertion ,then TableA insertion.   
- **Brute Force Programming**
    - CommandInvoker directly interacting with CommandReceiver . I guess this doesn't have flexibility of command stacking and undoing commands.
    - Note `undo` and `queuing/listing commands` is noticeable features of this command
- **Intuitive Example**
    - CRUD DB commands, especially CUD(which has commit(execute) and rollback(unExecute) capabilities)
    - Undo/Redo Notepad Editor Commands(Cut/copy commands) 
- **UML**
    - [UML](UML.puml)
- **Code Example**
    - ???
- **Pros**
    - Client and Server decoupled 
    - queuing/listing commands by having a MacroCommand
    - Undoing Command or queue of commands
- **Cons**
    - 
- **Comparision with Other Patterns**
    - vs Facade Pattern (because decouples Client and Server)
        - Facade is a wrapper over a service , Command encapsulates request or Command 
    - vs CoR(queuing or chaining)
