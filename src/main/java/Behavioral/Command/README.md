##### Command Pattern
- **Naming**
    - `Encapsulating Command or Request` 
    - `Decouple CommandInvoker and CommandReceiver`. Client only passes command to commandInvoker, unaware of who is CommandReceiver and how command will be executed
    - ~Supports~ Can use `undo` or `unexecute`, so that command can be undone
- **When To Use**
    - When you want to parameterize the CommandReceiver behavior by encapsulating Command
    - When Client need to maintain a list of commands ,i.e. a MacroCommand delegating task to mini commands . Yet again Note , MacroCommand is only useful if it is re-usable, else listing should be handling at Client Side , else If there are 'n' number of commands, `2^n` number of MacroCommand possible , which will be unnecessary if not re-used.      
- **Brute Force Programming**
    - CommandInvoker directly interacting with CommandReceiver . I guess this doesn't have flexibility of command stacking and undoing commands.
- **Intuitive Example**
    - [Remote Control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-pattern/)    
    - Notepad Editor Commands(Cut/copy commands) 
- **UML**
    - [UML](UML.puml)
- **Code Example**
    - ???
- **Pros**
    - Client and Server decoupled 
    - queuing/listing commands by having a MacroCommand
    - Undoing Command or queue of commands
- **Cons**
    - 
- **Comparison with Other Patterns**
    - vs Facade Pattern (because decouples Client and Server)
        - Facade is a wrapper over a service , Command encapsulates request or Command 
    - vs CoR(queuing or chaining)
