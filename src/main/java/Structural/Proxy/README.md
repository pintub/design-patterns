##### Proxy Pattern
- **Naming** `Proxy is a dummy in place of a real object`
- **When To Use**
    - When there is an object which is resource intensive(heavy), or remote object(proxy can be used as cache here), you can use a proxy object which is like a gateway before access an actual object . Web browser proxy settings also one kind of proxy .
    - Client accesses proxy object first .If data available, proxy returns data, else "proxy accesses original object". If you think of caching strategy, it's like "Read-through" strategy. Cache itself gets data from DB.     
- **Brute Force Programming**
    - Eagerly accessing the original heavy object
- [**UML**](UML.puml)
- [**Code Example**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/proxy-design-pattern/)
    - Client unaware of Actual Class
- **Pros** 
    - You can manage the lifecycle of the service object when clients donâ€™t care about it.
    - `You can control the service object without clients knowing about it.`
    - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new proxies without changing the service or clients.   
- **Cons**
    - ???
- **Comparison with Other Patterns**
    - vs Prototype (Because of Naming :innocent:)
        - Prototype is for cloning whereas Proxy is a dummy for Real service
