##### Composite Pattern
- **Naming** `Tree structure, made of composite component and Leaf components of same behavior`
- **When To Use**
    - When composite component(having collection of components) and Leaf components form a tree-like structure and all components have same behavior.
    - Note the phrase `same behavior` of all components
- **Brute Force Programming**
    - Separate Classes for composite and Leaf component and at Client use a `if else` for perform operation on these component . For example, If Leaf, leafComponent.behavior() .Else if compositeComponent, [GetCollectionComponents and childComponent1.behavior() + childComponent2.behavior() so on]
- **Intuitive Example**
    - House building , House has Room(Composite Component) has Smaller Room has Floor(Leaf Component) with same behavior
- [**UML**](UML.puml)
- **Code Example**
    - `TODO`
- **Pros**
    - You can work with complex tree structures more conveniently: use polymorphism and `recursion` to your advantage.
    - No need of If else in Client . Rightly said, if there is `If Else` , there is opportunity of polymorphism.
- **Cons**
