##### Abstract Factory Pattern
- **Naming** `A Factory of objects, It is an extension of Factory method Pattern to create family of related objects`
- **When To Use**
    - When a client want to create a family of related objects(Example Platform Specific object family , For Mac platform UI , need {MacSpecificButton,MacSpecificDialog etc} and for Windows UI , need {WindowsSpecificButton,WindowsSpecificDialog etc}, because MacSpecificButton can't fit in WindowsSpecificDialog)
    - Note the phrase `family of related objects`  
- **Brute Force Programming**
    - Having if else clause in Client class(if parameter=mac, create MacSpecificButton and MacSpecificDialog)
- **Intuitive Example**
    - platform-independent UI(Mac specific Button + Mac Form for Mac) and (Windows specific Button + Windows Form for Windows)
- **UML**
    - [Factory building family of same type objects](FamilyOfSameProductTypeObjectsUML.puml) - You can ignore this
    - [Factory building family of Different type objects](FamilyOfDifferentProductTypeObjectsUML.puml) - Example, for volkswagen, it needs engine, battery , wheels specific to that car. So factory would have createEngine(), createWheel() etc.
- **Code Example**
    - `TODO`
- **Pros** `Same as Factory method Pattern if you have already seen`
    - Decouples and encapsulates the creation logic to separate class
    - if such creation logic needed for multiple clients, good to have factory object for code reuse.
    - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code
    - You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
- **Cons**
    - ???
- **Comparision with Other Patterns**
    - vs Factory (Beacuse of name)
        - Factory pattern is a factory of single objects , whereas AbstractFactory is a factory of family of related objects
