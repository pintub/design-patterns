##### Builder Pattern
- **When To Use**
    - When a Class has 'n' number of fields . 5 are mandatory fields and 'n-5' are optional . In such cases Builder pattern can be used with mix of constructors(For required fields) and `withProperty()` methods(FOr optional Fields)
- **Brute Force Programming**
    - Having 2^n constructors
- Types
    - ~~w/o Explicit static Class~~ `Not considered as Pattern`
    - w/ Explicit static Class
- **Pros**
    - Reduced number of constructors and increases re-usability of `withProperty()` methods
- **Cons**
    - Complexity increases if Class has sub-classes `Covered in Effective Java Item2`
